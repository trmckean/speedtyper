    SpeedTyper is a game designed in the Swift programming language for the iOS platform. The game presents a user with a block of text and asks them to type it in their keyboard. The goal of the game is to type the text as fast as possible and with as few errors as possible. This software is meant for users who want to know how to create a simple game using the Swift programming language and also for users who want a lightweight way to test their typing skills.
    This game is a work in progress and has a lot of features that could reasonably be added.
    
# Current implementation:
    Shows the user a block of text and records the amount of time it takes to put them in. Uses a very simplistic means of calculating errors, one that needs to be fixed.

# WEEK 3 UPDATE
Contributions this week: Began to learn the Swift lanaguage in an attempt to extract the Python prototype and create an iOS version of the game.
Pushes to the github will come this weekend. 
Next steps:
  - Figure out how to deal with errors in typing better than using the .zip() function so that one error does not cause the remaining
  string to be considered in error.
  - Deal with newlines in the example string
  - Create basic UI for iOS app
  - Create data strucuture (Database) for different strings that can be used. Find example strings that are of varying complexity
  and compartmentalize them by difficulty. Also make sure that all strings are legal to use.
