# speedtyper
Game in which a user types a phrase and they are timed and shown their word per minute, errors, and accuracy.

# WEEK 3 UPDATE
Contributions this week: Began to learn the Swift lanaguage in an attempt to extract the Python prototype and create an iOS version of the game.
Pushes to the github will come this weekend. 
Next steps:
  - Figure out how to deal with errors in typing better than using the .zip() function so that one error does not cause the remaining
  string to be considered in error.
  - Deal with newlines in the example string
  - Create basic UI for iOS app
  - Create data strucuture (Database) for different strings that can be used. Find example strings that are of varying complexity
  and compartmentalize them by difficulty. Also make sure that all strings are legal to use.
