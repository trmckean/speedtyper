SpeedTyper is a web application designed to allow a user to test their typing skills. SpeedTyper is currently implemented using JavaScript and HTML5. It also uses the open source JavaScript library called Phaser. It works by moving through game states in Phaser and allowing the user to play the game over and over again. First the game selects a random phrase and then times the user as they complete it accurately. Only correct input is accepted and all mistakes are tracked by the app.
The current implementation does not have a solid backend and could use improvement. I intend to add a more attractive GUI for the user and also add a database so that a lot more phrases can be added. In addition, the database would allow for user information to be stored so proper progress could be tracked.

# Build Instructions
1. Clone the github repository or download as a .zip
2. Run the index.html file either from the command line or by clicking.
3. The current implementation is only tested with Google Chrome, so make sure that browser is installed.
